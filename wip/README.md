## WHY?

This is yet another project that I will progress and I gain more knowledge. I want this project to be my babystep project. I will look for and use random libraries in this application and so the readme, along with the application will grow as I go on.

## TypeScript
Just because it seems cool to tell people that I can develop in TypeScript. No other special reason.

## Next Js
I want this application to grow, adding in a backend in the future, developing more pages as I find more libraries to play with.

## react-hook-form
I wanted to use this library because it just seemed like a solid way of building forms without having to worry about the nitty-gritty. There is a bit of a pain-point in trying to get the validate function to work with my password field. Let's hope I can crack this soon!
