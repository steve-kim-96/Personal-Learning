# Todo project

I've started this project as it's easy enough to pick up but also wanted to practice TypeScript and SASS.

I am not proficient at TypeScript and this project was meant to enhance my skills by at least a little bit.

# Learnings

I tried importing my todo interface, and found it difficult to incorporate the onchange handle for the checkbox and weaving it through
three componenents.
For the most part it was very familiar as my first language was JavaScript but also the fact that I need to make sure that nothing is implicitly type any...
especially the HTMLInput types... Still need to get the hang and many Google searches

SASS is very versatile but my CSS needs obvious work before I can call myself an expert at this point
