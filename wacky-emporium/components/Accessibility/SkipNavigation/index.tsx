    <h3>Accessible to all!</h3>
    <p>
      Accessibility doesn't just mean you can read things on the page and access
      all information. It also means that the same sort of accessibility to
      apply to everyone using your website. If the same information takes
      someone who is less abled a minute to access compared to someone who can
      access it in 10 seconds... is that information truly accessible???
    </p>
