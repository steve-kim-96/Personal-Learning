    <h3>Landmarks??? Like the Sky Tower?</h3>
    <p>
      NO! Not the Sky Tower silly. Landmarks refer to notable portions on the
      website that are easily referred to. For example, take the navigation bar
      at the top of this website. It's globally present and navigates the user
      to specific parts of the websites where information is held; the Home page
      is the main entrance, and there are exhibits like this one where I'm
      showing information about certain things.
    </p>
    <p>
      The navigation itself is a landmark and it's referred to as a Banner. It's
      notable, and easily referrable.
    </p>
  </div>
