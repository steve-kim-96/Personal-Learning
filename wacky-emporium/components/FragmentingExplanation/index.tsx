    <h3>Fragmenting and a bit of code splitting</h3>
    <p>
      So, instead of returning divs inside of divs inside of divs, and so on,
      fragmenting is just a clean way to lay things out. Obviously we need divs,
      but I've always asked myself from all those different group projects at
      EDA... Why so many divs we have???
