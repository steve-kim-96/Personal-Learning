    <p>
      Going through the first part of the advanced guidelines in the React docs,
      I thought this to be really interesting and wanted to do a project where
      every single tip, hack, hook, guide, whatever is on the same project. So!
      That's what I'm going to do. This here, is the idea of accessibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm not going to explain any concepts, that's not what this is for. I'm
      just applying everything I've learnt so far about accessibility.
    </p>

export default AccessibilityHeader
