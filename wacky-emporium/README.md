## Welcome to Steve's wonderful wacky emporium

Why? 
Why not? 

I was glossing through the React docs and found myself saying, how do I practice these concepts? Do I need to style everything? Do I need to spend time on other stuff?

No, I didn't. I thought to myself "why not just dump everything onto one project? Is it going to be pretty? Heck no! But I'll be able to practice everything won't I?

I'm not going to put all my time in this, but as I learn more and more about React, the more this website will develop. Eventually, why not style it? I'm practicing with SASS as we
speak, so maybe?

In any case, all the concepts, hooks, guides, anything I learn, I'm going to make a page for it here.
Gives me practice with TS and Next.js as well so that's just a bonus :)
