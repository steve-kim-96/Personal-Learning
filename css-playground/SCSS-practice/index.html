        Hi everyone. For a while I've always wanted to practice css styling because out of everything that I currently know how to do in terms of coding, it is the one skill that I
        really lack, like a backhand shot for tennis, or using the weaker foot in football. I want to make sure I'm sharp in all areas so I created this static page so I could be free
        to style it however I wanted. At EDA, Don's famous saying is "embrace the struggle" and that is what I plan on doing with this little ongoing project.
