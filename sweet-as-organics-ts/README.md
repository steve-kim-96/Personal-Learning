## Having a play around with Redux

I've been itching to play around with redux again for a while but I was trying to get a hang of TypeScript first. Although far, far away from being an expert of TypeScript,
I thought I was competent enough to tackle Redux. Really excited. Redux was always one of those things where I was absolutely in love with but did not love me back...
Time to change that!

## Practicing more TypeScript and React

Practice makes better right? It'll take a while for me to master but the best I can do is better myself.

## Sadly just SQLITE3

Yes... I'm using SQLITE3. It's not bad but I didn't want to burden myself by trying to learn lots of thigns at once. FOCUS on one thing at a time.
This time it's redux, but who knows?
